Capability maturity assessments have become a common way to gauge the "goodness" of a certain system / process against
a model considered to be a best practice for that specific subject matter.

Maturity is usually represented on different levels allowing an organization to assess its the current level,
the preferred target level and how to close the gap between the two. Decision regarding the best target level are
usually made by evaluating the benefits of reaching that level and the cost associated in achieving and maintaining
such as a level.
