Capability maturity models have become a common way to describe the expected best practices for a system / process 
within certain domain.

Maturity is usually represented on different levels allowing an organization to assess its current level,
the preferred target level and how to close the gap between the two. Deciding which is the best target level
usually depends on the benefits from reaching that level and the cost associated in achieving and maintaining
such as a level.

Although there are several maturity models available, their structure is fairly similar: a given _maturity model_
entails a series of vertical levels (e.g. from 1 to 5) with horizontal _maturity areas_ (e.g. requirements management)
that cut across each level. Every combination of level / area becomes a _maturity dimension_ that can be assessed 
and scored through a _maturity assessment_.
