Project portfolio management is a relatively new discipline concerned with the challenges of managing multiple 
projects at once, such as:

+ Same time delivery of different project types requires different and contradicting management methods
+ Scaling the Agile practices within a controlled environment can be difficult
+ Summarizing current status and trends from many disparate and too detailed project views can be cumbersome

taoPPM's was born to cope with this challenges in a simple and straightforward way by focusing on the three key 
project portfolio management processes: 

+ _Portfolio definition_, responsible for the projects identification, categorization, prioritization and selection; 
+ _Portfolio evaluation_, responsible for the analysis of the financial, qualitative and risk profiles of projects 
together with their interdependency and stakeholders makeup; 
+ _Portfolio delivery_, responsible to bring the projects to completion within controlled duration, cost, and quality 
performances by applying an agile gate management approach.

Although there are already different methodologies and tools targeting the PPM area, taoPPM wants to provide a
superior support to strategic alignment and gate-based performance auditing which should be central to successful
governance and management control.

> taoPPM has been created by distilling available methodologies and practices to a simpler and more focused set of 
recommendations. In this way, managers can first and foremost focus on the 20% of project portfolio management that 
yields 80% of the advantages
