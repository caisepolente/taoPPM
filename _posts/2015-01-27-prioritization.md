A priority is the level of delivery importance or precedence a project has compared to other projects, as judged by a relevant stakeholder.
Stakeholders can base their judgement on a number of factors, including categorization values assigned to the project
or outcomes of the project evaluation process.

Projects with higher priority will be preferred to projects of lower priority when either finite resource are
not sufficient for all projects or temporal precedence has to be given to specific projects since not all
projects can be delivered at the same time.

Prioritization of projects can be based on qualitative priorities or rankings.

A **qualitative priority** assigns a non-exclusive priority value to a project based on how it fares in a specific
priority compared to other projects. To ensure comparability between projects, qualitative prioritization should use
the same qualitative scale across different priority types and projects.

A **ranking** assigns a priority value based on an ordinal scale that, once assigned, is exclusive to the assigned project.
The ranking level represents a unique position in the ordinal scale.

Stakeholders will follow a process of successive prioritization refinements, involving several steps of negotiation
and adjustment culminating in a final prioritization decision. The structuring of qualitative priorities in groups
and priorities should align to the stakeholderâ€™s decision-making structure.

Both interim refinements and final decisions should be formalized in separate prioritization versions.
This speeds-up the refinement process and provides an historical record for future reference.
