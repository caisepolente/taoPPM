Each project and portfolio should be periodically reviewed to evaluate its performances 
against qualitative assessment models such as satisfaction surveys, delivery process quality
or governance adherence.

Different _review templates_ can be defined for a _review type_, 
ensuring full comparability across projects and easy aggregation of results. Each review template
will have several _review items_ (such as the different questions of a questionnaire template).

A project or portfolio would then periodically or when needed send such review template to its stakeholders. 
The stakeholders would then be expected to provide a scoring for each review item and a review comment.

_Example of review types:_

  + Stakeholder surveys
    + For _portfolios_:
      + Quarterly Portfolio Assessment
      + Annual portfolio IT Audit
    + For _projects_:
      + Post Implementation Review
      
  + Process effectiveness evaluations
    + For _portfolios_:
      + Portfolio health-checks against management best practices
    + For _projects_:
      + Project health-checks against management best practices (e.g Prince2, PMI, Scrum etc.)
