## Agile Gate Management process
This gate process entails the definition of standard stage/gate management processes
comprising predefined sequential management gates with expected project outcomes
and gate performance data at each gate.

This process should not be confused with the project method or technical delivery
method (such as Agile, RUP, Prince2, or any other proprietary project management
method) that usually defines the project or product lifecycle phases with the
specialist or technical deliverables expected at each phase.
This technical method is considered part of project management and to detailed
for the portfolio management process.

There is a trade-off between variety of gate processes adopted and level of delivery
control of the portfolio since different processes will challenge the comparability
between project performances at gate reviews.

Additionally, the higher the number of gates the tighter is the control on the
projects but also the overhead for both the controllers and the projects.

A gate represents a point in time, while a stage represent a time interval delimited
by two gates.
The start gate identifies the start of the project and the end gate identifies the
end of the project. Both gates should always be present for any project.

The characteristics of the typical portfolio of projects a company faces should be
used to identify the most appropriate number and type of gate processes.

Project characteristics that could be taken in consideration to determine the granularity of the gate process are:

  + Budget/size
    + Large projects favours break-up in multiple gates
    + Small projects favours minimal gates or just Startup and Closure
  + Risk
    + The riskier the project, the higher the number of gates
  + Strategic importance
    + The higher the strategic importance, the higher the requirements of deeper and frequent control by management leading to a higher number of gates.

## Gate review data
A gate management process is assigned to each project and the gate review data is
recorded at each gate review.
Baseline, estimate and actual performances are recorded for the duration, cost and
completion dimensions.

Baseline and estimate should be provided for the current gate and all the
successive gates at each gate.

Actual data should be provided only for the current gate at each gate.

Changes to baseline or actual data should only be made through a formal gate review
or an approved change requests. Changes to estimates can only be made when
communicated as part of a project status or at a gate review.

Gate outcomes are evaluated by assigning outcome scores at each gate review for
the current gate.

The history of all changes to performances and outcomes should be recorded in time
and accessible for auditing and trending analysis.
