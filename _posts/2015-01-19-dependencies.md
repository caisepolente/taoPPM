This process entails the management of dependencies among projects. 

When a project requires a deliverable/milestone to be achieved or provided by another project, this constraint 
should be captured as a _dependency_. 

A dependency should identify the _source project_ expected to produce the deliverable and the _target project_ that 
requires that deliverable. 

The deliverable will be expected on a certain date and, if not delivered on time or as 
expected, it will have a _dependency impact_ on the target project.
